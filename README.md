# ðŸ§  GenAI for Data Scientists

This repo is a **practical, structured guide for data scientists transitioning into Generative AI** â€” built from scratch to go from traditional ML to deploying GenAI applications.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?
If you're familiar with machine learning and want to ramp up on GenAI *without getting lost in hype or research papers*, this is for you.

#### ðŸ§ª Purpose
This is not a polished course or GenAI hype repo. It's a **deliberate, hands-on learning path**. The goal: arrive at *practical readiness* to work with modern GenAI stacks â€” from LLM fundamentals to real deployments.
