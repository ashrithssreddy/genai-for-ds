# ðŸ§  GenAI for Data Scientists [Migration Pending]

This repo is a **practical, structured guide for data scientists transitioning into Generative AI** â€” built from scratch to go from traditional ML to deploying GenAI applications.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?
If you're familiar with machine learning and want to ramp up on GenAI *without getting lost in research papers*, this is for you.

#### ðŸ§ª Purpose
This is not a polished course or GenAI hype repo. It's a deliberate, hands-on learning path. 
The goal: arrive at *practical readiness* to work with modern GenAI stacks â€” from Nueral Network fundamentals to real genAI app deployments.

## ðŸ§± Learning Flow

Each notebook is self-contained and builds on the prior:

2. [`Deep Learning`](./98_html_exports0/02_deep_learning.html) â€“ Concepts like depth, activations, backprop  
3. [`Transformers Architecture`](./98_html_exports0/03_transformers_architecture.html) â€“ The core building block of LLMs  
4. [`Large Language Models`](./98_html_exports0/04_large_language_models.html) â€“ What makes a model an LLM  
5. [`Prompt Engineering`](./98_html_exports0/05_prompt_engineering.html) â€“ How to use models effectively  
6. [`Fine Tuning LLMs`](./98_html_exports0/06_fine_tuning_llms.html) â€“ When and how to fine-tune  
7. [`Huggingface Workflows`](./98_html_exports0/07_huggingface_workflows.html) â€“ Real-world tooling and workflows  
8. [`GenAI Use Cases`](./98_html_exports0/08_genai_use_cases.html) â€“ Common applied patterns (Q&A, summarization, etc.)
