# GenAI for Data Scientists

This is a personal learning repo where I explore Generative AI concepts, tools, and techniques â€” with a focus on how they intersect with data science workflows.

## Goals
- Understand foundational concepts behind LLMs and GenAI
- Practice using popular GenAI libraries and APIs
- Build small prototypes and experiments
- Document learnings along the way

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Step-by-step explorations and tutorials
- `docs/`: Notes, references, and learning resources
- `scripts/`: Standalone Python scripts
- `experiments/`: Scratchpad for testing ideas
- `models/`: Model files, configs, or outputs (optional)

## Getting Started
This repo is a work in progress. Feel free to browse, fork, or suggest ideas.

## Resources
A curated list of resources will be added in [`docs/resources.md`](docs/resources.md)
